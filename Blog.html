                “The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers” – Robert. L. Glass <br> Great developers are rare. 
                Their productivity is 3 times that of an average developer and 10 times that of a bad developer*. 
                The top 1% developers in the world don’t just write solid code but have important intangible traits. 
                After working with over 1000 developers, we have been able to identify 7 qualities that set great programmers apart.
                <h4>1. POSITIVE ATTITUDE</h4>
                <p>
                    A great programmer cares about your product. They are positive, willing to go the distance to 
                    get the job done and bring their best everyday. Although it’s important not to exhaust a 
                    developer with frequent urgent deadlines, sometimes this is unavoidable. When you need to 
                    bring a product to market or need to ship a certain feature out by the deadline, the great 
                    programmer will step up and get the product released whenever possible. Because they care. 
                    A great developer doesn’t let their ego get in the way of taking feedback. A good way to 
                    instill a positive attitude is to give them interesting projects to work on, give them a 
                    sense of ownership and praise them for good work. Startups can give out stock options,
                     pay employees for working overtime, provide compensated paid leave or find other perks
                      that ensure great programmers are retained ...............

                GitHub is one of the largest code repositories in use today. 
                Every year they create a Year in Review report, sharing statistics about their programmer community. 
                We use this data as another indicator of language popularity. <br>

                In this post, we also attempt to predict the future of programming languages. <br>
                
                We use a wide variety of resources to predict the fastest growing languages and the most influential languages. 
                Of course, all of these insights are up for debate, but they are worth considering if you want to stay ahead of the curve.

                Computer is an electronic device used in almost every field even where it is most unexpected. That is why this age is called as the era of IT. And now we cannot imagine a world without computers. It is made up of two things one is the hardware and other is software. All physical components of computer like keyboard, mouse, monitor etc comes under the hardware whereas all the programs and languages used by the computer are called software. These days computers are the tools for not only engineers and scientists but also they are being used by millions of people around the world.
Computer has become very important nowadays because it is very much accurate, fast and can accomplish many tasks easily. Otherwise to complete those tasks manually much more time is required. It can do very big calculations in just a fraction of a second. Moreover it can store huge amount of data in it. We also get information on different aspects using internet on our computer</td>
