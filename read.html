                “The best programmers are up to 28 times better than the worst programmers” – Robert. L. Glass <br> Great developers are rare. 
                Their productivity is 3 times that of an average developer and 10 times that of a bad developer*. 
                The top 1% developers in the world don’t just write solid code but have important intangible traits. 
                After working with over 1000 developers, we have been able to identify 7 qualities that set great programmers apart.
                <h4>2. SUPREME COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h4>
                <p>Good communication skills directly correlate with good development skills. A great developer is able to understand problems clearly, break them down into hypotheses and propose solutions in a coherent manner. They understand concepts quickly, or ask the right questions to understand, and don’t need to have everything written down in a specifications document. Great offshore developers usually speak multiple languages coherently and are very comfortable with documentation in English. In the world of technology, English is the defacto language of most documentation and developer interactions. If they don’t speak it well enough, they’ll require interpreters and translators, making their knowledge second hand, and quickly outdated </p>
                <h4>3. GREAT AT TIME AND TASK MANAGEMENT</h4>
                <p>Great developers are highly reliable. They have a strong work ethic and show up at meetings on time. An important skill is the ability to estimate the amount of time needed to complete a task, communicating this and delivering on it. Exceptional developers are great at managing their clients or leaders instead of you managing them</p>
                <h4>4. QUICK LEARNING ABILITY</h4>
                <p>Great developers are usually amazing self-learners. They have the ability to learn new technologies on their own and aren’t intimidated by new technologies. They have the ability to pull disparate bits of information and process information on the fly. Every programmer will experience a situation where he or she doesn’t know the answer. Great programmers will find different resources, talk to the right people and find the solution no matter what. The best skill anyone can have is knowing how to learn, and great developers have mastered the skill of self-learning</p>
                <h4>5. DEEP AND BROAD TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE</h4>
                <p>Great developers have worked with a handful of technologies long enough to become experts and are competent with many. Of course, finding a programmer who has worked on a product similar to yours or that uses the same technologies important. The right programmer for your project will be able to hit the ground running because they already know the right technologies. They will follow coding standards and will write code that is understandable and commented where necessary and can be passed on to someone else easily. By combining their cognitive abilities and diverse industry experience, they’re able to arrive at optimal solutions quickly. An experienced developer is well versed in best practices like agile development, task management software (Jira, Trello, etc.), version control (If they know Git, it’s a sign they’ve moved on past older systems like SVN), and working in different environments (local development environment, and working knowledge of deploying applications) so ask them about these things.</p>
                <h4>6. A GOOD TEAM PLAYER</h4>
                <p>Another superb quality of premium developers is their ability to help other developers get better. They offer teammates help when they are stuck, teach new skills to others and write documentation that would help teammates not only in their organization but the developer community in general</p>
                <h4>7. HIGH-END USER FOCUS</h4>
                <p>A good programmer does what is asked of them while a great programmer thinks of the end user of the software and works to solve problems for them within the abilities of the organization. A great programmer wants to know the feature they’re building is of high value and pushes back when a feature creates no value for anyone.</p>

                <h4 id="d2">most popular programming languages</h4>
                <h4>1. java</h4>
                <p>According to Tiobe, Java has been the number 1 or 2 most popular language basically since its creation in the mid-90s. Many of the world’s biggest companies use Java to build desktop apps and backend web systems.
                            <br>
                    If you know Java, chances are you won’t be desperate for work!</p>
                <h4>2. C programming language</h4>
                <p>
                    C is one of the oldest, most popular programming languages, thanks to its near universal portability and early adoption by Tech’s biggest brands, including Microsoft, Apple, Linux, and Oracle.
<br><br>
C is also the most popular language for embedded systems in cars, electronics, and other devices.
<br><br>
Nearly everything that we touch today, from our cell phones to alarm clocks, is influenced by—if not directly written in—the C language
                </p>
                <h4>3. python</h4>
                <p>
                    The popularity of Python has risen steadily over the past 15 years, 
                    finally breaking the top 5 on the Tiobe Index a few years ago. 
                    This is because Python is a major language in some of the most exciting technologies today. <br> <br>

                   Machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Robotics all rely heavily on 
                   Python (Robotics also relies on C for its use in systems programming). Cyber Security, 
                   one of the top software challenges of our time, is also driven by Python. <br><br>
                   It’s surprising how simple Python is to learn. <br><br>

                It’s now the most popular introductory language taught in universities and often picked up by 
                experienced developers as a second or third language. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h4>4. javascript</h4>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the ubiquity of web browsers, JavaScript has become one of the most popular 
                    programming languages in the world, and number 1 on GitHub in terms of pull requests. <br><br>

                    There are notable complaints with JavaScript (more on that in a bit), 
                    but JavaScript has held its own against newer languages and will continue to play a 
                    significant role on the web. <br><br>

                    JavaScript allows developers to add interactive effects to web pages. 
                    It often works alongside HTML, but it’s becoming more common for web apps to be built entirely in JavaScript. <br><br>
                    Because of its simplicity and speed, more startups and tech businesses are starting to usebr
                    <br> <br>
                     JavaScript on the backend via the Node.js framework <br>
                </p>
                <h4>5. Ruby</h4>
                <p></p>
                Ruby is one of the most popular languages among tech startups. <br>
                Many Silicon Valley unicorns have been built on Ruby, including Airbnb, Twitch, 
                GitHub, and Twitter. Its popularity is bolstered (and perhaps dependent) on Ruby on Rails, 
                a full-stack web application framework that runs Ruby. <br>
                Ruby is beloved by developers for a number of reasons
